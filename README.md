# Nodejs
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code server-side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome web browser. Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side programming, which streamlines the development process, especially for web applications.
